Hi!
I'm sorry this code found you a little late.
I didn't expect it to take that long. but I know it was necessary to add some more functionality to the code to make it work better.

this project contains three parts:
1-  list: header & implementation
    includes all the functionality required in the assignment with some additional functions I thought were needed:
    - appendFirst: append a node at the head of the list
    - appendNode: append a node at the tail of the list
    - printfNode: print a specific node
    - printfAll: printf all nodes of a list
    - find: find a node in the list by its key
    - delete: delete a node in the list by its key
2-  utils: some functions for terminal color message display
3-  test: here's the main function where the program begins to execute

that's all.
hope you enjoy.
Alisina Soltani.
